## My favouratie dish - recipe:
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 2 red onions, chopped

  small bunch coriander stalks and leaves chopped separately
- 2 cans cherry tomatoes
- 1 tsp caster sugar

**STEP 1**
Heat the oil in a frying pan that has a lid, then soften the onions, chilli, garlic and coriander stalks for 5 mins until soft. Stir in the tomatoes and sugar, then bubble for 8-10 mins until thick. Can be frozen for 1 month.

**STEP 2**
Using the back of a large spoon, make 4 dips in the sauce, then crack an egg into each one. Put a lid on the pan, then cook over a low heat for 6-8 mins, until the eggs are done to your liking. Scatter with the coriander leaves and serve with crusty bread.

## The definition of the word "Pet":
The word “pet” comes from the Scottish Gaelic “peata”, which means “tame animal”. The word seemed to have evolved over time in the Scottish language into also signifying a lamb, an animal of companionship, or a child who is spoiled or the “favorite among the bunch” (aka “teacher's pet”.)
